    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>
        Canada as an independent nation has a rich history that all started in the nineteenth century when confederation in Canada started. <a href=”http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1468854891549”>That was one hundred and fifty years ago </a>. On this website, we are going to look back at the first forty years of independent Canada in a timeline spanning from 1850 to 1890.

    <h3>1850 - 1859</h3>



    <p><a name=”chapter1”>The</a> decade started out with tragedy, when on the 18th of September 1850, U.S. congress passed the fugitive slave act, which stated that citizens are required to assist capture and return runaway slaves. Those who did not could be fined or jailed for their actions. This was a large factor in forming the <a href=”http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/underground-railroad/”> underground railroad </a>, a group of abolitionists who helped black slaves in the United States escape to the northern states and, you guessed it, Canada. It is estimated that around <a href=”http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPCONTENTSE1EP8CH1PA3LE.html”> 
30,000 African-American slaves fled to Canada</a> during the mid-nineteenth century. </p>

    <p> <a name=”chapter2”>Among</a> the important people of these racially tremulous times was a brave individual by the name of <a href=”http://www.biography.com/people/mary-ann-shadd-cary-214141”> Mary Ann Shadd</a>. Shadd was an American-born abolitionist who moved to Canada during the mid-nineteenth century with her brother. It was here that she became the first African-American newspaper editor in North America with her work on the Provincial Freeman: a weekly newspaper published for escaped slaves and Canadian Africans alike. <a href=”http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/africam/pfhp.html”> The Freeman would run until 1857</a> .

    <p><a name=”chapter3”>During</a> the last few years of the decade, racial tensions had grown high in the United States due to the increasing number or pro-abolitionists in the Northern states. It was around this time (1857) that Queen Elizabeth declared Ottawa the new capital of the Canadian Province. Ottawa still stands as the capital of our country today. The 1850s ended with a violent bang, when an arsenal at Harpers Ferry was raided by abolitionists. The main culprit of this revolt? John Brown, an extreme abolitionist whose actions would end in execution. A federal offensive led by future confederate general <a href=”http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/biographies/robert-e-lee.html”> Robert E. Lee </a>quickly put down the revolt, killing most of Brown’s men and capturing the leader himself. John Brown was hanged for his crimes on December 2, 1859, at the age of 59. This was one of the main events that sparked the American Civil War in 1861.</p>

    <h3>1860 - 1869</h3>



    <p> <a name=”chapter4”>Only</a> a year into the 1860’s and the most devastating war in U.S. history broke out. The two belligerents involved were the Union States (the north) and the Confederate States (the south). Formed in the same year that civil war broke out, the Confederacy consisted of eleven southern states who seceded from the U.S. prior to the war. These were:

        <ul>
            <li>South Carolina</li>
            <li>Mississippi</li>
            <li>Florida</li>
            <li>Alabama</li>
            <li>Georgia</li>
            <li>Louisiana</li>
            <li>Texas</li>
            <li>Virginia</li>
            <li>Arkansas</li>
            <li>Tennessee</li>
            <li>North Carolina</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Most say that the main cause of the war was the issue of slavery in America. You had the Northern states, led by President Abraham Lincoln, who were leaned towards abolition; and the Southern States, led by Jefferson Davis, who defended slavery as a way of life down south. The tension finally climaxed when Fort Sumter was besieged by the Confederate army, ending in the surrender of its defending force and the declaration of war by both sides. The North suffered heavy defeats early in the war in battles such as the First Battle of Bull Run and the First Battle of Lexington, but as years went on the South’s shortage of men, materials and money took a heavy toll on them, until the Confederate states finally ran out of steam and surrendered four years later in 1865, when Confederate general Robert E. Lee signed official surrender of the CSA.

    <p>
        The casualties were staggering. It is estimated that approximately 620,000 soldiers died during the course of the war, making it<a href=”http://www.civilwar.org/education/civil-war-casualties.html?referrer=https://www.google.ca/”> the bloodiest conflict in American history</a>. After the war the Confederate states joined the United States again, and slavery was officially abolished across the nation. Abraham Lincoln - who was president throughout the years of the war - is well known and respected today for this feat. Little did he know it would spark his assassination in 1865 while visiting the Ford Theater Washington D.C.. Some of the important battles fought in this war include:
        <ul>
            <li>The First Battle of Bull Run</li>
            <li>The Battle of Lexington</li>
            <li>Shiloh</li>
            <li>Antietam</li>
            <li>Gettysburg</li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        <a name=”chapter5”>It</a> was during the summer of 1867, that the most important event in Canadian history occurred in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Confederation in ‘67 was to Canada what the signing of the Declaration of Independence was to America. Due to the increasing difficulty of several different provinces being governed by one party, the idea became a reality when delegates from <a href=”http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/confederation/”> four different provinces</a> came together and created a unified, independent Canada, with its first Prime Minister being John A. Macdonald, who would be in power until 1873. The other provinces that later joined excluding the first four (Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) from earliest to most recent are:
        <ol>
            <li>Manitoba (1870)</li>
            <li>Northwest Territories (1870)</li>
            <li>British Columbia (1871)</li>
            <li>Prince Edward Island (1873)</li>
            <li>Yukon (1898)</li>
            <li>Alberta (1905)</li>
            <li>Saskatchewan (1905)</li>
            <li>Newfoundland (1949)</li>
            <li>Nunavut (1999)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        <a name =”chapter6”>The</a> Fenian raids were a series of attacks on British-Canadian forts and strongholds across Canada from 1886 to 1871. The two belligerents involved were the Fenian Brotherhood and the Canadian army. The Fenian Brotherhood was a group of Irish rebels whose purpose in the conflict was to pressure the British who were closely related to Canada into withdrawing from Ireland, which was at the time under Canadian rule. The Fenians would have small aggressive incursions into Canada from the United States to raid Canada. Many of these were led by General John O’neill, who was considered a hero among the Irish. All of these raids were eventually put down by government forces, but cost the lives of dozens on both sides. After these events, the Canadian Government enforced their border heavily to lessen the threat of future invasions. The battles that took place during this conflict were:

        <ul>
            <li>Campobello Island Raid</li>
            <li>Niagara Raids</li>
            <li>Missisquoi County Raid</li>
            <li>Battle of Trout River</li>
            <li>Pembina Raid</li>
        </ul>
    </p>



    <h3>1870 - 1879</h3>



    <p>
        <a name=”chapter7”>One</a> of the biggest events of the early 1870’s was the Red River Rebellion - an uprising in the Red River Colony from 1869 to 1870. Many of the people involved were Metis peoples: descendants of Euro-Indian people. This included their leader <a href=”http://www.biography.com/people/louis-riel-9458603”>Louis Riel</a>, who for many years would lead the cause for keeping the territory that belonged to his people . The main cause of the rebellion against the federal government were the Metis peoples’ fear of losing their territory to the government and the <a href=”http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/eras/clash%20of%20empires/HBC.html”>HBC</a>. And so a group of rebels took a nearby fort, and decided to occupy it until the government would agree to negotiate. Armed conflict ensued for a while, during which Riel made the fateful decision to permit the trial and execution of Canadian government official Thomas Scott. Despite Riel now becoming an outlaw in the west, the Canadian government still agreed to create Manitoba as a Canadian province with the Manitoba Act in 1870.

    <p>
        <a name=”chapter8”>In</a> 1873, Canadian Parliament passed a new law which would create the Northwest Mounted Police (or the NWMP) to combat increasing violence in the northwest territories of Canada which was caused by <a href=”https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_History/The_Whiskey_Traders_and_the_NWMP”> American Whiskey traders</a> coming into Canada. They were also conceived as a way to prepare the more secluded parts of Canada for possible settlement. One of the important elements of doing this was to rid the areas of crime, as well as making relations with the First Nations people in the region. Some important figures in the native community such as Chief Crowfoot sought good relationships with the new visitors and welcomed the “mounties” in to their land. The NWMP would go on to keep the Northwestern territories safe until 1921 when they merged with the dominion police to form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

    <p>
        <a name=”chapter9”>Despite</a> some of their friendships with the mounties, first nations people were by no means considered equals. In 1876, the government passed the Indian Act and consolidated with it the Gradual Civilization Act and the Gradual Enfranchisement act. These new laws goals were to assimilate the native people into western Canadian culture through restricting their traditional freedoms. Here were some of the laws that passed during the early stages of the Indian Act:
        <ol>
            <li>Native people were barred from practicing religious ceremonies like the
                <a href=”http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/potlatch/”>Potlatch</a> (1884)</li>
            <li>Catholic Residential Schools were put in place to teach First Nation children white christian values at a young age (1894)</li>
            <li>First Nation dancing was banned, both off and off reserves in 1925</li>
            <li>It became illegal in 1927 for First Nations people to hire lawyers regarding land claims without the government’s consent</li>
        </ol>
    </p>



    <h3>1880 - 1889</h3>



<p>
<a name=”chapter10”>In</a> 1881 and 1884, roughly 17,000 Chinese immigrants came to British Columbia for a new opportunity, to work as labourers on the Canadian Pacific Railway - which had originally been conceived in 1871 as the connector between the east and west coast of Canada that would convince B.C. to join confederation. Immigrants were paid a measly dollar a day for backbreaking work, which was less than what their co workers of other races earned. The hard work many workers had endured finally came to an end in 1885, when Donald Smith drove in the final railway spike or “the last spike”, officially finishing the construction of the C.P.R. which would become a crucial trade route across independent Canada.

<p>
<a name=”chapter11”>In</a> 1885 there was another brief uprising from the Metis people, referred to now as the North-West rebellion. A force of a couple hundred led by Louis Riel - who had returned from exiles couple years before - challenged around 900 Canadian troops. The Metis believed that the government had failed to protect their rights and their land. After several skirmishes many casualties on both sides the Metis force was squashed at the siege of Batoche. Riel was quickly captured, tried for treason and hanged. His legacy would live on in the hearts of the Metis people as a hero. The key events that took place during the rebellion in order were:
<ol>
<li> Battle of Duck Lake</li>
 <li>Looting of Battleford</li>
 <li>Frog Lake Massacre</li>
 <li>Battle of Fort Pit</li>
 <li>Battle of Fish Creek</li>
 <li>Battle of Cut Knife</li>
 <li>Battle of Batoche</li>
 <li>Battle of Frenchman's Butte</li> 
<li>Battle of Loon Lake</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<a name=”chapter12”>It</a> was in 1883 that the Woman’s literary club founded by Dr. Howard Emily Stowe - the first female doctor to practice in Canada - turned into the Woman’s Suffrage Movement in Canada. The right to vote was a big issue for Women across the globe during the late 19th century and the early 20th. This was the sole cause for Stowe to lead a suffrage movement across Canada for years. Eventually in 1915 four provinces gave women the right to vote and hold public office. The rest eventually followed throughout the early 1920s and 30s.
