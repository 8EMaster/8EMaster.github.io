      Hi there, my name is Robert. Currently, I am teaching the students of 8E basic HTML. Some people wonder how this is possible...
      well, at my school, Humberside C.I., I am taking a course called "Cooperative Education". Ever since grade 5, I have wanted to
      take this course. I was inspired by a former 'co-op' student. Currently I am in grade 11 - since grade 9 I 
      have been working hard to ensure that taking this course was an option.

    <h4> Here is an image of my fav. animal (turtles)! </h4>

      I have had turtles for a long time - since grade 7 or 8... Currently I have 4: Minks, Biscuits, 'Nilla, and Pickels. In 
      addition to my turtles, I also have guppies. Interesting fact, guppies are fragile creatures, they can die easily if their 
      enviornment is not up to standard.

    <h4> Here is a soundtrack that I really like. </h4>

      This soundtrack is from the godfather. Personally, I really love this movie, I would rate it in my top three most fav. movies.
      Although the movie is about the american/italian mofia, there are many important themes that are portrayed in the film. If you
      would like to see the wiki, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather">click me</a>.
