      Hi there, my name is Robert. Currently, I am teaching the students of 8E basic HTML. Some people wonder how this is possible,
      well, at my school, Humberside C.I., I am taking a course called "Cooperative Education". Ever since grade 5 I have wanted to
      take this course. When I was in grade 5 I was inspired by a former 'co-op' student. Currently I am in grade 11, since grade 9 I 
      have been working hard to ensure that taking this course was an option.
