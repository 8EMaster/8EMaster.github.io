<p>The American Civil War is the most bloodiest war in US History it lasted from 1861-1865. Some of its causes are as followed in the list below.
   <ul>
       <li>Slavery, the Union wanted to get rid of slavery while the confederates wanted to keep it. </li>
           <li>Sectionalism, The different cultures and societies between the North and the South. The North had Industrialized, urbanized, and built farms. The South used plantations and slaves to farm. </li>
               <li>Protectionism, the South had a lower manual labor, had little perceived mechanization, and had the right to sell cotton and purchase manufactured goods from any nations. The North invested in their still-nascent manufacturing, could not compete with Europe's industries offering high prices for cotton imported from the South and low prices for manufactured exports in return.</li>
                   <li>States Rights, the South said the each State had the right to leave the Union at any time, that the union was an agreement among the states. The North rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the founding fathers. </li>
                   <li>National Elections,
                   <li>Territorial Crisis, at first the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were divided equally between slaves and free states. It was over territories west of mississippi were proslavery and antislavery collided. </li>
                   <li>Nationalism and Honor,
                   <li>Lincoln's Election, The leaders from the South feared Lincoln would put an end to slavery. Before Lincoln came into office the South formed a confederacy. </li>
